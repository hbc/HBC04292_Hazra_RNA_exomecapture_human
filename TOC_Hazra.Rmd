# Project Info

-   Project: `hbc04292`

-   Analyst: `Emma Berdan`
-   Experiment: `RNA seq of human breast cancer samples`


# Overview 

This is a large clinical dataset with an enriched number of samples for women of color. Both cases and controls are present. There are a total of 143 samples, after QC 141.

# bcbio_stuff (Folder)

These are all the files used for the initial bcbio run

# bulk_rna-seq_QC_Hazra.Rmd

Standard RNA QC

# bulk_rna-seq_DE_Hazra.Rmd

Initial deseq2 analysis looking at age, race, case vs. control, follow up time, and surgery. Surprisingly there were no DE genes for case control

# bulk_rna-seq_DE_Hazra_gsea_case_control.Rmd

As a follow up to the above analysis we used the full case/control results to run GSEA in an attempt to extract any biology. We found several enriched terms. 


# ciberstort.rmd

This takes the output from cibersort (CIBERSORTx_Job1_Results.csv) and looks for differences in cell type composition.
There were not any.

# bulk_rna-seq_DE_Hazra_grade.Rmd

In previous DE models surgery was used instead of grade since they were highly correlated. In this we used grade instead. This is the analysis that the client moved forward with.

# bulk_rna-seq_DE_Hazra_caseonly.Rmd

The major goal of this analysis was to look for genes linked to the reoccurance of breast cancer.

# COI analyses (folder)

These analyses looked at the role of the childhood opportunity index which was extracted (not by us) from neighborhood data.

# Hazra_COI_correlation_exploration.Rmd

This looked at the relationship between COI and other clinical covariates. This was just an exploratory analysis with no stats.

# bulk_rna-seq_DE_Hazra_grade_zip.Rmd

This examined the role of COI in gene expression and the interaction between COI and case/control and COI and race.
